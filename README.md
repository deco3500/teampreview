#Introduction
The project is called Before the Trailers and aims to address the bias in movie reviews. It will do this by calculating an adjusted score for the given review based on the reviewer’s history against other reviewer’s history.

#Concept
A web application that gathers reviews from other websites, sources and from user submission that allows users to read those reviews and view the scores free from the bias of the reviewer. This will be done by creating an adjusted score for a movie from the reviews history compared against other reviewer’s history. When the user views a review for a movie there will be two scores displayed being the reviewer’s score and the adjusted score calculated by the website. This will give the user an idea of what the reviewer really thinks of the movie. Users can sign up and become reviewers themselves and post their own reviews. Other users can rate reviews if they feel the review is accurate. Users can search reviews history to see how they reviewed things in the past to see if they align with their reviews align with how they reviewed the movie.
Users can create a feed of reviewers and add their favourites to keep track of reviews they will find valuable.

The application will send users movie suggestions based on other reviews from the application. These suggestions would serve to inform the user of the movie such as a movie that has been out for some time but recently the similar users have rated highly. 

Comparing to existing movie review websites, such as http://www.imdb.com/ and https://www.rottentomatoes.com/, we will average out the user’s reviews based on the previous reviews they have given to similar movies, which will eliminate the biased opionions due to personal preference.

Decision
Decisions will be made by three quarters majority or in the case of a stalemate the team leader(Angus) will decide. 

Poor Performance
The member will be asked to explain the reasons that lead to the situation and actions to be taken to prevent it from happening again.If the reason for the problem is unacceptable or the same problem continues, the other group members will notify the course staff of it. If the problem remains, the course staff will be notified that the group wishes to have a peer review.

Conflicts
Individuals will have equal chance to speak, and hear all sides to gain a full understanding of the issue. The situation will be assessed from all sides; a fair and reasonable solution will be made that everyone will agree upon. If the issues remains unresolved due to disparity of opinions between members, the problem will then be escalated to the course staff for mediation.

#Communication
The team will meet on Fridays after 12pm at University of Queensland if needed. There will also be communication through facebook to organise/discuss issues. All files will be stored and shared through Github while utilising Source Tree to continuously obtain and update working files. The team will be utilising CamelCase as their primary file naming convention. The social platform that has been adopted for the team is facebook due to all team members being on the platform and it also being the fastest method of communication for the team.
